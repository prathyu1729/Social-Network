--Title- Basic Social Networking Management System

This project is aimed at designing the database and the underlying views and queries (with optimisations)
to support typical functions of a social network, such as instant messaging, private messaging,
status update and friend requests.

The application database will be based on MySQL to store user entries, their login activities, and activities about
their networking, messaging and the content they share.

Backend has been handled using PHP. Frontend will be handled using Javascript(Ajax), HTML and CSS(Bootstrap).

The user will first join the service using a custom form for enrollment. Once an account is created, the user will be
able to choose from options such as Messaging, Posts' management and News Feed through an interactive menu and buttons.
A dedicated page to display and customise their own profile will be available. The user can thus involve themselves with
the content, post some new content or chat with their 'friends' through our portal.
Posts can be commented upon, and can be edited by the users too.

XAMPP is used to create the MySQL server on the local host. Please create a databse called social_network in your XAMPP
and import the tables from the attached social_network.sql.
